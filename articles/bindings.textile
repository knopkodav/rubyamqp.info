h2. About this guide

This guide covers bindings in AMQP 0.9.1, what they are, what role they play and how to accomplish typical operations using the Ruby amqp gem.

h2. What Are AMQP 0.9.1 Bindings

Bindings are rules that exchanges use (among other things) to route messages to queues. To instruct an exchange E to route messages to a queue Q, Q has to _be bound_ to E. Bindings may have an optional _routing key_ attribute used by some exchange types. The purpose of the routing key is to selectively match only specific (matching) messages published to an exchange to the bound queue. In other words, the routing key acts like a filter.

To draw an analogy:

 * Queue is like your destination in New York city
 * Exchange is like JFK airport
 * Bindings are routes from JFK to your destination. There may be no way, or more than one way, to reach it

Some exchange types use routing keys while some others do not (routing messages unconditionally or based on message metadata). If an AMQP message cannot be routed to any queue (for example, because there are no bindings for the exchange it was published to), it is either dropped or returned to the publisher, depending on the message attributes that the publisher has set.

If an application wants to connect a queue to an exchange, it needs to _bind_ them. The opposite operation is called _unbinding_.

h2. Binding queues to exchanges

In order to receive messages, a queue needs to be bound to at least one exchange. Most of the time binding is explcit (done by applications). To bind a queue to an exchange, use {% yard_link AMQP::Queue#bind %} where the argument passed can be either an {% yard_link AMQP::Exchange %} instance or a string.

<pre>queue.bind(exchange) do |bind_ok|
  puts "Just bound #{queue.name} to #{exchange.name}"
end</pre>

{% gist 998727 %}

The same example using a string without a callback:

<pre>queue.bind("amq.fanout")</pre>

{% gist 998729 %}

h2. Unbinding queues from exchanges

To unbind a queue from an exchange use {% yard_link AMQP::Queue#unbind %}:

<pre>queue.unbind(exchange)</pre>

{% gist 998742 %}

<span class="note">Trying to unbind a queue from an exchange that the queue was never bound to will result in a channel-level exception.</span>

h2. Bindings, Routing and Returned Messages

h3. How AMQP 0.9.1 Brokers Route Messages

After an AMQP message reaches an AMQP broker and before it reaches a consumer, several things happen:

 * AMQP broker needs to find one or more queues that the message needs to be routed to, depending on type of exchange
 * AMQP broker puts a copy of the message into each of those queues or decides to return the message to the publisher
 * AMQP broker pushes message to consumers on those queues or waits for applications to fetch them on demand

A more in-depth description is this:

 * AMQP broker needs to consult bindings list for the exchange the message was published to in order to find one or more queues that the message needs to be routed to (step 1)
 * If there are no suitable queues found during step 1 and the message was published as mandatory, it is returned to the publisher (step 1b)
 * If there are suitable queues, a _copy_ of the message is placed into each one (step 2)
 * If the message was published as mandatory, but there are no active consumers for it, it is returned to the publisher (step 2b)
 * If there are active consumers on those queues and the basic.qos setting permits, message is pushed to those consumers (step 3)
 * If there are no active consumers and the message is *not* published as mandatory, it will be left in the queue

The important thing to take away from this is that messages may or may not be routed and it is important for applications to handle unroutable messages.

h3. Handling of Unroutable Messages

Unroutable messages are either dropped or returned to producers. Vendor-specific extensions can provide additional ways of handling unroutable messages: for example, RabbitMQ's "Alternate Exchanges extension":http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html#alternate-exchange makes it possible to route unroutable messages to another exchange. amqp gem support for it is documented in the "Vendor-specific Extensions guide":/articles/broker_specific_extensions/.

RabbitMQ 2.6 introduced a new feature called "dead letter queue" where unroutable messages will be put instead of dropping them.

The amqp gem provides a way to handle returned messages with the {AMQP::Exchange#on_return} method:

<pre>exchange.on_return do |basic_return, metadata, payload|
  puts "#{payload} was returned! reply_code = #{basic_return.reply_code}, reply_text = #{basic_return.reply_text}"
end</pre>

"Working With Exchanges":/articles/working_with_exchanges/ documentation guide provides more information on the subject, including full code examples.
